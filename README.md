 # Investment Portfolio Management System (SQL)
This project involves creating a relational database system to manage investment portfolios using MySQL. It includes tables for Investors, Portfolios, Assets, Transactions, and MarketPrices. The system tracks asset transactions (buy/sell), portfolio performance, and historical market prices.

Key features include:

Database Design: Created a normalized schema for efficient storage of investor, portfolio, and asset data.
Transaction Management: Handled asset transactions, including buy/sell operations with quantities and prices.
Market Price Tracking: Stored and analyzed historical market prices for assets like equities, bonds, and commodities.
SQL Queries: Used advanced SQL queries to analyze portfolio performance and asset transactions, including joins, aggregates, and subqueries.

This project showcases proficiency in SQL, database design, and querying to simulate real-world investment portfolio management.
